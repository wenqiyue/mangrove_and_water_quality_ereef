# mangrove_and_water_quality_ereef
Investigate effect of mangroves on water quality using data from the eReefs project

This project is taken as part of University of Sydney's ENVI 5809 Environmental Sinulation Modelling course, taught by Prof. Tristan Salles

Group member: Ruiqi Luo, Cong Wang, Kexin Yang, Wenqi Yue

We explored datasets provided by eReef's simulation output to investigate changes in water quality indicators
that could potentially linked to mangrove damage and recovery at HinchinbrooK Island, Queensland, Australia following Cyclone Yasi at 2011-02-03
